# ✈️ Trip Expense Tracker

A personal travel expense tracker built with **Flask** and **SQLite**. Log expenses across multiple trips, filter by category or payment method, and export your data — all tied to your own account.

## Live Demo

The app is deployed and accessible at https://accounting-app-dt7o.onrender.com

Hosted on Render. Note that the app may take 30–60 seconds to load on first visit as Render spins down free-tier services when inactive — just wait a moment and it will be up.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using **Werkzeug's** `generate_password_hash`
- All database queries are filtered by `user_id` from the server-side session — users can only access their own data
- URL parameter tampering returns empty results, not another user's data
